# ðŸ“² Registration Form
This registration form is an excellent showcase of my capabilities in web development, crafted with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a user-friendly interface for data entry, complemented by a sophisticated design that highlights the usability of the form. This project not only demonstrates my proficiency in front-end development but also illustrates my ability to integrate simple JavaScript functionalities like looping through years for a graduation date selection.

## ðŸŒµ About the Project
This project involves a custom registration form that I designed and implemented. The form is developed using HTML and CSS for layout and styling, with JavaScript enhancing the form's functionality. A key feature of the JavaScript implementation is a loop used in the "Graduation Date" field, which dynamically generates years for users to select from.
